# night_night

A personal Flutter project that aims to create an app for hand free video/audio player while sleeping.
- Uses Youtube API and Youtube_explode_dart for videos

**Technically a lesser Youtube in the current version with the feature of auto closing.

## Closes after:
- A certain number of videos watched or
- a set duration is reached

## Future features (no promises)
- reduce loading time
- adding a home page
- adding user profile
- adding other sources for video/audio through api or packages (haven't look into it yet)

## problems
- maybe using way too much stateful widgets
- loading time
- probably will not be accepted into ios/android app store due to the auto closing feature
- files not really sorted
- not so optimize data usage (at least i assume)
